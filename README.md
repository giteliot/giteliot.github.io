## intro
Hi! I am Elia, in my spare time my main interest is playing around in the interstection between gaming and ai. You can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elia-chinellato-041a695a/), [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/codewithnohands) or [email](email:eliachinellato@gmail.com). Here is the stuff I have worked on lately, from most to least recent. I apologize if the quality is offensively low :D 

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">  <img src="assets/shankd_logo.png" alt="Image" style="width: 64px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;"> <div> <b>Shankd</b> is a 1v1 battling game. Made in Unity and its MLAgents library. </div> </div>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">   <div> tiny adventures is an attempt to use LLMs to work as a game master.
The attempt failed unfortunately, as I wasnt able to make either the story compelling enough, or actually playable by the user.
